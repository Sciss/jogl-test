# jogl-test

## building

Builds with sbt. Currently, the following libraries must be manually placed in `lib`:

    gluegen-rt.jar
    gluegen-rt-natives-linux-amd64.jar
    jogl-all-natives-linux-amd64.jar
    
These come from https://jogamp.org/deployment/jogamp-current/archive/jogamp-all-platforms.7z
